1.OVERVIEW

React Hooks are a new feature recently added to React (released v16.8). React is heading in a direction which makes class components 
unnecessary. In the industry there has been a push away from class based components. Hook's have rendered them unnecessary. React Hooks
are a way to hook into the lifecycle of a component using functional components. Now you do not need class components for state or almost 
all of the lifecycle methods. Instead you can use functional components across the board. There are some lifecycle methods currently not 
supported by Hooks, getSnapShotBeforeUpdate and componentDidCatch. But both of these methods are fairly uncommon. Hooks also dramatically
improve readability and organization of components. Can also create custom hooks to reuse code across app. Below is a list of the 10 built
in hooks React provides:
