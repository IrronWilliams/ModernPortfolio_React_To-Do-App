1. REACT ROUTER SETUP

The mapping of the files are:

index.js is rendering an App component
App.js is rendering a Head component and an h1 that say Home Page
Header component is rendering an h2 that says Pic Some and an icon of a shopping cart from remixicon. This is in a folder called Component. 
Pages is another folder. Pages are teh components that will render when React Router is rendering a certain route. 
    Photos is the homepage and will render on the / route. 
    Cart is the cart page and will render on the /cart. route. 

index.html includes a couple of cdn links.
    Google fonts API that allows me to use the Oswald font
    Remixicon css sheet. 


# Objective

1. Set up React Router for app. 

2. Click on the words "Pic Some" in the header to go to the "/" route, which should display the Photos component 
(found in the pages folder)

3. Click on the shopping cart icon in the header to go to the "/cart" route, which should display the Cart component 
(found in the pages folder)
